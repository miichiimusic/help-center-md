## Why this matters

Proton SoundSystem is a platform for distributing music, but their standard contract includes language that assigns away your composition rights. This can severely affect our ability to register your works, collect royalties on your behalf, and help you maintain control over how your music is used in the future.

If the Proton contract is signed as-is, WAYU Publishing will not be able to register the composition on your behalf, as the contract assigns those rights to Proton and the record label by default. The agreement is structured to give exclusive rights to both the master and the composition unless otherwise amended. While the label rightfully retains the master, the composition side (your songwriting and publishing rights) can easily be lost unless you take action beforehand.

## Contact us before signing

If youâ€™re about to release a track through a label that uses Proton, **pause before signing anything**. The moment a record label sends you the Proton agreement, please reach out to us.

Weâ€™ll walk you through the necessary steps to protect your publishing rights without disrupting the release process. Our goal is to make sure you retain control of your compositions and continue collecting royalties.

## Use the official amendment provided by Proton

Proton has acknowledged this concern and allows artists to submit a **contract amendment** that separates the master rights from the composition rights. We provide this amendment for you, and itâ€™s fully valid under **Clause 11** of Protonâ€™s default agreement, which permits modifications with written approval from both parties.

Once downloaded, send it to the label manager using the email template below.

## Step 4: Send This Email to the Label

Copy and paste the following message, replacing the placeholders with your actual info:

```
Subject: Contract Amendment for [Release Name]

Hi [Label Manager Name],

I hope youâ€™re doing well.

I wanted to quickly share an official amendment regarding the release [Release Name]. Iâ€™m currently signed as a writer with WAYU Publishing, who now handle the administration and registration of all my compositions for music publishing purposes.

As such, Iâ€™ve attached a Proton Contract Amendment that clarifies I retain full ownership of the musical composition in this release, while you retain exclusive rights to the master recording, as per Protonâ€™s agreement. This amendment simply ensures that the publishing rights for the composition are not assigned as part of the default Proton contract.

This wonâ€™t affect your ownership or control of the master recording, it only applies to the composition side and allows me to manage my publishing directly through WAYU Publishing.

The amendment is valid per Clause 11 of Protonâ€™s default agreement, which allows for contract modifications with written approval from both parties. Please take a look, and if everything looks good, feel free to sign and return it at your convenience.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
```

## Final Reminder

Weâ€™re here to support your creative career and help you protect what youâ€™ve built. Sending this amendment is quick, easy, and ensures you continue benefiting from your songwriting and publishing long after the release is out. If you have questions or need help at any step, just reach out.
