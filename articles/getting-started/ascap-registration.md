> **Warning:** Non-U.S. residents must set up a U.S. bank account to receive payments prior to registering with ASCAP. This can be done through Payoneer, a service that provides you with a U.S. account and routing number. Refer to the Payoneer instructions for guidance.

## 1. Choose Your Member Type

You will need to choose **Writer** as your member type, as you are represented by WAYU Publishing. ASCAP will distribute your writer's share of royalties directly to you, while WAYU Publishing will distribute 50% of the publishing royalties to you as part of our agreement. This ensures you receive your full entitlements as both the writer and a participant in the publishing split.

## 2. General
In this step, you must confirm that you are **not a member of any other PRO**, as registering with ASCAP means that you currently do not have PRO representation. Next, provide your personal details, including your legal name, date of birth, phone number, email, and your US residency status.

**Important items in this section:**

- **Are you a US resident for tax purposes?**: US residents will be provided an IRS Form W-9; non-US residents will need to fill out an IRS Form W-8. Either form will be provided in Step 4 (Required Documents).

- **Tax ID Number**: Enter your Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. If you do not have one, leave it blank.
- **Genre**: Dance/Electronica
- **Stage Name**: Stage name is your recording artist or DJ name. Write your Artist name with the correct spelling including any capitalization. If you have more aliases, you can enter them as well.

## 3. Royalties
Proper payment setup is essential to ensure you receive your royalties seamlessly.  

Would you like to enroll in direct deposit? Select **Yes, enroll me in direct deposit.** Here, you will enter your U.S. bank account details, whether itâ€™s your personal U.S. bank account or a U.S. account created through Payoneer.

### For U.S.-Based Writers:
In this step, you will need to provide your U.S. bank account information. This ensures that you receive your writer's share of public performance royalties directly from ASCAP. Mechanical royalties will still be distributed to you via WAYU Publishingâ€™s system.

### For Writers Outside the U.S.:
Non-U.S. residents must set up a U.S. bank account to receive payments. By this stage, you should already have a U.S. bank account number provided by Payoneer. Please enter the account information from Payoneer into the required fields, ensuring all details match accurately.

## 4. Required Documents
If you are not a U.S. resident, you will need to download, complete, and upload an **IRS Form W-8BEN**. This form certifies that you are not a U.S. tax resident and establishes your eligibility for reduced or eliminated withholding tax rates under applicable tax treaties. Without this form, a higher withholding tax may be applied to your royalties. Completing the W-8BEN ensures you receive the correct royalty payments in compliance with U.S. tax laws.
