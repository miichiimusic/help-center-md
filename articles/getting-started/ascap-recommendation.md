At WAYU Publishing, we recommend ASCAP as your Performing Rights Organization (PRO) — an entity that collects and distributes royalties on behalf of songwriters, composers, and publishers when their music is performed publicly (such as on radio, TV, streaming platforms, or live venues). We suggest ASCAP because it is free to register, has a global network for tracking and collecting royalties, and provides timely, reliable payments. ASCAP also offers one of the largest international partnerships, ensuring your works are monitored across multiple territories. Their tools and resources make it easy for you to track your earnings, register your works, and receive payouts without unnecessary delays.

## Step 1 - Register with ASCAP

ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers) is a U.S.-based PRO that collects public performance royalties globally through reciprocal agreements with PROs in other countries. Registering with ASCAP not only allows you to start collecting public performance royalties but also provides you with your **IPI (Interested Parties Information) name number**, a unique identifier used worldwide to track and credit your works accurately.

ASCAP is free for writers and does not charge annual fees, though non-U.S. residents will need to set up a U.S. bank account, which can be done through Payoneer.

## Step 2 - Providing Your IPI Name Number

Your **IPI Name Number** (Interested Parties Information Number) is a unique identifier assigned to you by Performance Rights Organizations (PROs) like ASCAP, GEMA, BMI, etc. This number is essential for tracking and crediting royalties accurately to your account.

When registering to ASCAP, your IPI number is typically assigned immediately upon approval of your membership. However, even though the number is generated right away, it may take 3–5 business days before it becomes visible in your Member Access account.

> Once you have your IPI number, please send it to us at **contact@wayupublishing.com**.

> **Note:** Songwriter/Collaborator Name should always be the person's full legal name, not their artist or stage name.
