## Teams

Repositories in BaseHub are always inside a team, which can be Pro or Personal. When you create an account in BaseHub, a personal team is automatically generated and linked to your personal data. This team has the singularity that can’t have more members, and starts in a free-tier that could become billed if the usage increases (You can check out the personal team limits and pricing details here).

If along the way you discover you need to work with someone in a personal project, transferring that repository to a Pro team is a straight-forward task and you can read the step-by-step on this article.

> **Note:** Publishing rights are separate from master rights, which are tied to the sound recording. This is a common point of confusion.

## The Role of Performing Rights Organizations (PROs)

PROs like ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC in the U.S. collect royalties on behalf of songwriters and publishers. When your music is played on radio, TV, live venues, or digital platforms, these organizations track usage and issue payments accordingly.

| Name       | Role        | Active |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Alice      | Admin       | ✅     |
| Bob        | Contributor | ❌     |
| Charlie    | Viewer      | ✅     |

You’ll need to register both yourself (as a writer) and your compositions with a PRO. Without registration, you may miss out on a significant portion of your earnings — even if your music is performing well.

> **Warning:** Many streaming platforms do automatically register your compositions with a PRO. It’s your responsibility to ensure your works are properly submitted.

## Final Thoughts

The best time to understand your rights is before signing any agreement. Read every clause carefully, ask questions, and consult with someone experienced in music law if possible. The publishing landscape can seem overwhelming at first, but the more informed you are, the more you’ll retain control — and earnings — from your music in the long run.
