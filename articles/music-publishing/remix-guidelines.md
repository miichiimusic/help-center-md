At WAYU Publishing, we believe that transparency and fairness should guide how remixes are handled on the publishing (composition) side. Our goal is to ensure that both original creators and remixers are properly credited and compensated, depending on the context of the remix.

Below you'll find an overview of how we handle remix situations across four main scenarios, as well as links to our email templates and agreement forms for each case.

## 1. Past Remixes of Your Works

If other artists have remixed one of your compositions in the past, those remixes default to being collected as part of your original work — meaning you will collect 100% of the publishing share.

However, there may be rare cases where the remixer registered the remix and claimed a small share based on their master participation.

We handle those instances case by case to ensure fairness and proper crediting.

> **Tip:** No action needed unless you notice a remix registered under your title by another party.

## 2. Past Remixes You Have Done

If you have created remixes of other artists' songs in the past, these can be treated as independent works on the publishing side.

If your remix introduces substantial new creative or compositional elements, you may propose a publishing split that reflects the value of your contribution (e.g., 50/50 or 60/40).

### 📨 Who to Contact

Depending on the original release setup, there are two common scenarios:

#### a. When the Record Label Holds the Composition Rights

If the original contract assigned the composition rights to the record label, contact both the label and the original artist. Explain that you'd like to register the remix as a separate composition, propose your ownership split, and include the Contract Amendment (completed with your name, date, and signature) for their review and signature.

#### b. When the Label Only Controls the Master

If the original label's contract only covered master recording rights (and not publishing), you can contact just the original artist or composer to confirm the composition split.

In this case, the agreement is purely between writers/publishers and does not involve the label.

If the original writer insists on full ownership, we consider that fair, especially when the remix relies heavily on the original composition.

## 3. Future Remixes of Your Works

Remixes that will be done to your works default to being collected as part of your original composition, meaning you will retain full publishing ownership unless otherwise agreed.

However, it's always good practice to send a short message or email to the label or remixer stating your intention to retain composition ownership.

## 4. Future Remixes You Will Do

When planning to remix another artist's song in the future, the publishing split should be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the creative and compositional contribution you expect to bring to the remix.

We encourage you to communicate this before starting the remix, by emailing the original artist and/or label with your intention and proposed split.

### 📨 Who to Contact

Depending on the original release setup, there are two common scenarios:

#### a. When the Record Label Holds the Composition Rights

If the future contract assigns the composition rights to the record label, contact both the label and the original artist. Explain that you'd like to register the remix as a separate composition, propose your ownership split, and include the Contract Amendment (completed with your name, date, and signature) for their review and signature.

### Negotiating Your Split

| Scenario | Typical Split | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Label/Artist reached out to you** | You have more leverage | You can negotiate a higher share since your creative contribution is being sought out |
| **You reached out to do the remix** | Typically up to 50% | Fair to discuss your expected contribution, but usually you'll have less leverage in claiming more than 50% |

> **Tip:** Open, early communication avoids disputes and ensures all parties understand the creative and publishing relationship before release.
