When you sign with WAYU Publishing, you’re entering into a five-year agreement in which the copyright to your compositions is assigned to us. This arrangement allows us to properly manage, register, and collect royalties on your behalf. This article explains why we use this structure, how it connects to the broader publishing system, and what it means for you as a writer.

## Why copyright assignment matters

Assigning the copyright to WAYU Publishing enables us to fully represent your catalog across all global societies and platforms, giving your music a proper foundation to be recognized, tracked, and monetized in the most accurate way possible.

Our role as your publisher involves registering your works with various performing and mechanical rights organizations around the world. These registrations need to be exact and consistent, or you risk missing out on royalties. Without a clear legal right to represent your works, we would be forced to submit more complex administrative agreements, which often delay registrations and increase the likelihood of errors, disputes, or unclaimed royalties.

By assigning the copyright, you authorize us to handle these registrations directly, without those complications. It streamlines the entire process.

## How this connects to global royalty collection (CWR System)

CWR, or Common Works Registration, is the global standard for music publishers to deliver works to royalty-collecting societies. It’s used by ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, SOCAN, SACEM, PRS, and hundreds of other collection networks.

When you assign us your copyrights, we can register your compositions directly with these societies using the CWR format. This allows us to resolve ownership conflicts quickly, collect royalties faster and more accurately, and eliminate metadata errors that often lead to delays or unpaid earnings.

If instead we were only acting as administrators, CWR requires additional agreement layers (AGR transactions) and more extensive metadata per work. This becomes more complex when there are multiple co-writers or publishers involved, and it can lead to mismatched registrations, blocked payments, or tracking failures.

Assigning ownership during the contract period solves this. It positions WAYU as the clear, authorized party in all CWR filings — making your catalog easier to protect and monetize across every territory.

## Your creative indentity

While the copyright is temporarily assigned to us, you continue to be credited as the writer in every registration, royalty report, and database. You still own your creative identity and the public recognition tied to your songs. We never alter, exploit, or distribute your works without your knowledge and consent.

Importantly, this assignment only applies to your compositions, not your master recordings. Those remain separate, and this agreement has no effect on the ownership or control of your audio files.

## What happens after 5 years

The agreement remains in place for five years and then automatically renews, unless you inform us otherwise. This gives your catalog long-term consistency, helping ensure your royalties are collected without gaps or delays across different royalty cycles and global distribution timelines. If you decide not to renew, your copyrights revert back to you, no paperwork or negotiation required. You simply notify us before the renewal date.

The automatic renewal structure helps ensure continuous representation of your works without administrative disruptions, while still giving you the freedom to decide whether you’d like to continue the partnership after the initial term.

## Our commitment to you

WAYU Publishing was created to empower independent artists like you. We’ve built our CWR system and catalog management tools with accuracy, speed, transparency and fairness in mind. The temporary copyright assignment is a technical necessity, not a creative constraint.

By assigning your rights to us, you’re giving your songs a home where they can be tracked, registered, and protected in the global music economy. And when the time comes, you can always take them back.
