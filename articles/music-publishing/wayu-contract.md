When you sign with WAYU Publishing, you temporarily assign us the copyright to your compositions for a specified period. This arrangement allows us to fully represent your catalog across all global societies and platforms, giving your music a proper foundation to be recognized, tracked, and monetized in the most accurate way possible.

Without a clear legal right to represent your works, we would be forced to submit more complex administrative agreements, which often delay registrations and increase the likelihood of errors, disputes, or unclaimed royalties. By assigning the copyright, you authorize us to handle these registrations directly, avoiding those complications. 

## How this connects to global royalty collection

When your music is played, streamed, or downloaded around the world, multiple royalty organizations get involved to track and pay out earnings. To make sure those royalties actually reach you, your songs need to be properly registered — with accurate info, clear ownership, and no confusion.

When you assign us your copyrights, we can register your compositions directly with these organizartions, allowing us to resolve ownership conflicts quickly, collect royalties faster and more accurately, and eliminate metadata errors that often lead to delays or unpaid earnings.

If instead we were only acting as administrators, the process would require additional agreement layers and more extensive metadata per work. This becomes more complex when there are multiple co-writers or publishers involved, and it can lead to mismatched registrations, blocked payments, or or royalties slipping through the cracks.

Assigning ownership during the contract period solves this. It positions WAYU Publishing as the clear, authorized party in all registrations, making your catalog easier to protect and monetize across every territory.

## Your creative indentity

A copyright assingment doesn’t change who wrote the music. You will continue to be credited as the writer in every registration, royalty report, and database. You still own your creative identity and the public recognition tied to your songs. We never alter, exploit, or distribute your works without your knowledge and consent.

Importantly, this assignment only applies to your compositions, not your master recordings. Those remain separate, and our agreement has no effect on the ownership or control of your audio files.

## Our commitment to you

WAYU Publishing was created to empower independent artists like you. We’ve built our system and catalog management tools with accuracy, speed, transparency and fairness in mind. The temporary copyright assignment is a technical necessity, not a creative constraint.

By assigning your rights to us, you’re giving your songs a home where they can be tracked, registered, and protected in the global music economy. And when the time comes, you can always take them back.
