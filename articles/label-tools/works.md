The **Works** section in Label Tools is where your full song catalog lives. Each registered composition you’ve submitted through WAYU Publishing is listed here with real-time status, usage, and royalty data.

This dashboard gives you transparency and control over your catalog, so you can see where your earnings come from and which songs are performing best.

## Works Table Overview

Each row in the table represents one registered work. Here's a breakdown of what each column means:

- **ISWC** This is the **International Standard Musical Work Code** for your composition. It’s like a fingerprint for your song in the publishing world.

- **Title** The name of your composition. You can click the title to open the detailed view.

- **Songwriters** All credited writers for the work. If you collaborated with someone, their names will appear here.

- **Publisher** Usually shows as **WAYU Publishing**, unless otherwise handled.

- **Acknowledgements** Displays which royalty collection societies (e.g., **MLC**, **CMRRA**) have confirmed this work.

- **Recordings** How many **commercially released recordings** are matched to this work.

- **Usage** The total usage data collected across platforms — this can include streams, views, or other interactions.

- **Collected Revenue** The amount earned by that specific work, updated regularly as royalties are processed.

- **Collecting DSPs** The digital platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, etc.) from which revenue has been collected. Hovering or clicking reveals more.

- **Status** Shows the current registration status (e.g., **Published**, **In Review**, etc.).
