Welcome to **Label Tools**, the centralized platform we use at WAYU Publishing to help our writers manage their catalogs, upload works, track royalties, match recordings, and stay organized. This platform simplifies the administrative side of your career so you can focus on what matters most—creating music.

This guide will walk you through how to get started, using real examples and screenshots from the platform.

## Dashboard Overview

When you log into Label Tools, you’ll land on the **Dashboard**, where you get a bird's-eye view of your publishing activity.

## Total Works Breakdown

This panel gives you a status overview of all your musical works in the system.

- **Draft** – Works you've saved but haven’t submitted yet.

- **In Review** – Works currently under review by the WAYU team or societies.

- **Approved** – Works that have passed review and are ready to be published.

- **Submitted** – Works you’ve submitted for review or processing.

- **Published** – Successfully registered and actively tracked for royalties.

- **Has Issue** – These works need your attention due to errors or missing info.

- **Not Eligible** – Works that don’t meet the eligibility requirements for registration or tracking.

## Collected Royalties

In the top right of your dashboard, you’ll find your current royalty stats.

- **Collected Royalties** shows your lifetime royalties earned.
- **Net** shows the amount after any deductions or distributions.

This graph also gives you a sense of how your earnings have trended over time.

## Activity Timeline

At the bottom of the dashboard is your **Activity Timeline**. This is where you can track any recent updates or changes made to your works.

You’ll see:

- Updates to acknowledgments from societies (like BMI, CMRRA, MLC)
- New works added or edited
- Tag indicators like `import`, `mlc`, etc., showing how the data was processed

Each entry is timestamped so you know exactly when an update was made and by whom (e.g., "Julian C. updated...").

> If anything in your activity feed looks unfamiliar or needs clarification, don't hesitate to contact the WAYU team.
