After clicking **New Work** from the Works page, you’ll be taken to the **Create Work** screen where you can register your composition with WAYU Publishing. This ensures your song is properly tracked and royalties are collected across DSPs and collection societies.

## Step 1: Fill Out Song Information

### Required Fields:

- **Work Title** Enter the official name of your composition. Do not include remix types, artist names, or version tags here.

  | ✅ Correct            | ❌ Incorrect                          |
  |-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
  | `Song Title`       | `Song Title (Original Mix)`        |
  

- **Lyrics Language** Select a language **only if the composition contains real lyrics** with clear, understandable words sung or spoken.

  | ✅ Select a Language When...                        | ❌ Do NOT Select a Language When...                |
  |----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
  | Full verses, choruses, or rap sections             | Short vocal sounds (e.g., “yeah”, “woo”)         |
  | Spoken word or narration                           | Humming, chanting, vocal chops                   |
  | Long, clear vocal samples with understandable words| Nonverbal vocal effects                          |

- **ISWC (optional)** ISWC stands for International Standard Musical Work Code — a unique identifier assigned to a musical composition (not the recording).  

  If your song has already been registered and assigned an ISWC, enter it here. 

  Example: `T-333.256.104-9` or `T3332561049`.  

  If you don’t know it, leave this field blank.

- **Alternative Titles (optional)** are other names your song may go by—like remixes, alternate spellings, or version tags.  
  They help with tracking usage and getting paid correctly.  

  **Examples:**
  - "Feel the Night (Extended Mix)"
  - "Feel da Nite"
  - "Feel the Night – Remix"

> **Note:** Remixes are by default collected as part of your original work.
>
> Please refer to [this article](../your-remix-policy-article.md) to understand how we treat remixes in more detail.

## Step 2: Add Songwriters and Splits

This section defines who contributed to the composition and how ownership is split.

### Fields:

- **Songwriter/Contributor** Start typing your name and select the correct match from the list. If you're the one registering the work, your name will usually appear pre-filled by default.

> **Note:** Songwriter/Collaborator Name should always be the person's full legal name, not their artist or stage name.

- **Role** refers to the specific contribution you or a collaborator made to the composition. Choose the role that best describes what you or a collaborato did—whether it's composing music, lyrics, or assisting with the arrangement.

Below are the standard **writer role codes** and their meanings. For the most part, your role or the collaborator's will be either of the first three options:

| **Role**                | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Composer                | Created the music (melody, harmony), but not the lyrics.                        |
| Author (Writer of lyrics)| Wrote only the lyrics.                                                         |
| Composer and Author     | Wrote both the music and the lyrics.                                           |
| Adaptor                 | Adapted an existing composition into a new version.                            |
| Arranger                | Reworked or reorganized the musical structure of the composition.              |
| Sub Arranger            | Contributed arrangement elements under a lead arranger.                        |
| Sub Author              | Helped write the lyrics, but not the main lyricist.                            |
| Translator              | Translated the lyrics into another language while preserving meaning.          |
| Income Participant      | Shares in the income but did not contribute creatively.                        |

- **Ownership Split** Enter the percentage of the composition that this writer owns.  
  *Do not include the publisher’s share. Use 100% if you are the sole writer.*

- **IPI Number** This should auto-fill for verified songwriters. It ensures payments are routed correctly.

<div style="background-color:#a6ffdcff; border:1px solid #a6ffdcff; padding:1em; border-radius:8px; margin:1em 0;">
  <strong style="color:#b45309;">Tip:</strong> Use <strong style="color:#b45309;">Add Another</strong> if the song has multiple co-writers.
</div>

## Final Step: Save Your Work

Once everything is filled out:

- Click **Create** to save and submit the work.
- Or use **Create & Create Another** if you're submitting multiple songs at once.

> **Alert:** You must register every unique version of a composition with its correct writer splits. This ensures proper royalty distribution and avoids conflicts with societies.
