Record labels and music distributors often provide contracts that cover both the master recording and the composition (your songwriting and publishing rights). While itâ€™s standard for the label to retain ownership of the master, some agreements also assign or claim rights over the composition â€” often without clearly separating the two. 

At WAYU Publishing, we frequently see agreements that prevent us from registering your works or collecting royalties on your behalf because the composition has already been assigned to the record label or distributor.

> **Warning:** **Warning:** If you sign such a contract without reviewing it, you may unintentionally give away your rights to collect royalties or control how your music is used, which can conflict with your publishing agreement and limit your long-term earnings.

> **Tip:** **The Good News:** Amendments can still be added even after a contract has been signed, as long as both parties agree in writing. So even if youâ€™ve already signed something, it's not too late â€” just get in touch and weâ€™ll help guide you through the process.

## Contact us before or after signing a contract
Whether you're preparing to release music through a record label or distributor, or you've already signed an agreement, it's important to make sure your composition rights are protected.

If you're affiliated with WAYU Publishing, reach out to us before signing â€” or even after â€” and weâ€™ll review the contract with you. We will provide an amendment to send to the record label or distributor, ensuring that you retain 100% of your composition rights.

This process doesnâ€™t slow down releases and can still be applied retroactively with mutual agreement. Itâ€™s a simple but important step to safeguard your publishing and royalty collection in the long run.

Contract Amendment for [RELEASE NAME]
```

**Email Body**
```
Hi [LABEL MANAGER NAME],

Hope you're doing well.

Iâ€™m currently in the process of registering my catalog for music publishing, and I wanted to share an amendment related to the composition side of the contract for [RELEASE NAME].

The amendment clarifies that Iâ€™d like to retain ownership of the composition(s) embodied in [RELEASE NAME], while you continue to hold exclusive rights to the master. This allows me to manage my music publishing registrations without affecting your rights to the release in any way.

Please take a look at it, and if everything looks good, feel free to sign and send it back.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,  

[YOUR NAME]
```
